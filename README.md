# VNC-Client Library for C#

High-performance cross-platform VNC-Client library for C#.

**This library is currently in alpha state, but has proven to be quite stable and is ready for daily use.
A stable release and much more documentation will follow, as soon as it's feature-complete. Until then, please take a look at the included AvaloniaUI sample project to see how it can be used.**
